# Attendance-Grabber-Project
this project uses python to be able to monitor the attendance of employees using face recognition
Each employee is given unique user name and password and scans his picture in the signup
the data of each employee is saved in database (excel) so that it is not deleted each runtime
when the user scans for attence his face tells his name and the time of attendace is saved in the excel file 
employees can be added and removed at run time which means the system is dynamic
